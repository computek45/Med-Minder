# Med Minder created by Kevin Wright this is a smaller version Med Tracker.
# This program was made to me to remember to take my medications.
# I also thought it other people do the same.
# Here looking at you kid, LOL. Hope you stay in good health!!!
# Completed on Janurary 23, 2019.

# I use alarm.py for the check the time when the medication needs to be
# taken and to make the buzzer sound.
